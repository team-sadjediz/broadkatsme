                    Broadkats.me is a web application that links multiple users to a server hosted browser for real-time group streaming of videos and browser-hosted content.  
                With the rapid proliferation of technologies for interconnecting users across the world online, the technology community has already begun to pioneer websites and applications engineered to provide a mutually-shared online hub. Applications such as Team-Viewer and Discord allow users to share or access anotherâ€™s screen without requiring a physical presence, an especially useful functionality for long-distance relationships of any kind. However, despite the existing community for this particular feature, not many have implemented these services in such an all-accessible user-friendly manner. The goal of broadkats.me is to build an easy to use web application for the streaming community to stream together.
